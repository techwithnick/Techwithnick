<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects and Portfolios I Have Created</h2>

- <b>Data Structures and Algorithms Practice (AlgoExpert)</b>
  - [#1](https://github.com/)
- <b>AWS Lambda Function (Python 3.13) with EventBridge rule and SNS Topic: When AWS Account accepts its invitation into AWS organization, EventBridge rule listens for AcceptHandshake event in CloudTrail, and sends notification email to an endpoint via Simple Notification Service (SNS).</b>
- <b>AWS Lambda Function (Python 3.13) with EventBridge rule and SNS Topic: When AWS Account is moved from root to an Organization Unit (OU) within AWS organization, EventBridge rule listens for MoveAccount event in CloudTrail. Depending on which OU the account is moved to, a perspective set of Groups and Permission Sets are assigned to that account, and also sends notification email to an endpoint via Simple Notification Service (SNS).</b>
- <b>AWS Lambda Function (Python 3.13) with EventBridge rule and SNS Topic: When a new group is created in Entra ID, it is SCIM synced to AWS. EventBridge rule listens for CreateGroup event in CloudTrail, and triggers the Lambda function. Lambda function (based on predefined table) will map the new group to its perspective permission set, and assign them both to the targeted account. Finally, an email is sent for notification whether the new group was compliant or not, with success confirmation via SNS. Ex.) Group AWS-ECAdmin-123456789012 is mapped to Permission Set AWS-ECAdmin and both are assigned to AWS account number 123456789012.</b>
- <b>Azure runbook created (Powershell) to gather AWS Identity Center data from several AWS environments, and place the data in an Azure table.</b>
- <b>Azure runbook created (Powershell) to migrate group membership from oldgroup -> new group.</b>
- <b>Azure runbook created (Powershell) to transfer PIM group membership from active PIM to PIM eligible.</b>
